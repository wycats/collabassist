# From Agents to Collaborators — Detailed Slide Layout Spec

*A designer-focused canvas for building the deck by hand in Canva or similar tools.*

This document describes, for each slide:

* A **markdown-style structure** of the content.
* **Step-by-step layout instructions** for how to build the slide visually.

Assume a 16:9 landscape presentation.

---

## Slide 1 — Title

### Markdown Structure

```md
# From Agents to Collaborators

_Presented by Yehuda Katz_
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Background**

   * Use the purple/lavender background used in the deck.
   * Add a thin, light horizontal rule near the very top edge, spanning the full width.

2. **Right-side Illustration**

   * On the right half of the slide, place the robot illustration used in the talk.
   * Make it full-height and align it to the right edge.
   * Apply a monochrome or overlay treatment so it sits comfortably in the purple palette.

3. **Title Block**

   * In the left half, lower-left quadrant, set the title text `From Agents to Collaborators` on two lines.
   * Left-align the text and use a large display size consistent with other H1 slides.
   * Leave generous empty space above the title so it doesn’t crowd the top rule.

4. **Presenter Line**

   * Below the title, aligned to the same left edge, add `Presented by Yehuda Katz` in smaller text.
   * Use a lighter weight and smaller size than the title.

5. **Overall Feel**

   * The right side is dominated by the illustration; the left side is mostly empty space and type.
   * No subtitle or extra bullets; the slide should feel like a clean opening poster.

## Slide 2 — The Moment We’re In

### Markdown Structure

```md
# The Moment We're In

Demo Promises:
- AI AGENTS EVERYWHERE!
- FULLY AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOWS!
- REPLACE YOUR TEAM!

Day 90 Reality:
- LLMs look powerful in demos and benchmarks.
- Production workflows expose brittleness, gaps, and glue code.
- Most value today comes from humans and AI working together.
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title**

   * Place `The Moment We’re In` as a large heading near the top-left.
   * Keep plenty of space between the title and the content below.

2. **Demo Promises (Left)**

   * Slightly below the title, toward the center-left, add a small label `Demo Promises`.
   * Under this label, place three speech-bubble shapes:

     * `AI AGENTS EVERYWHERE!`
     * `FULLY AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOWS!`
     * `REPLACE YOUR TEAM!`
   * Vary the sizes and angles slightly so they feel noisy and promotional.
   * Use a brighter turquoise/teal accent for the bubble outlines and text.

3. **Day 90 Reality (Right)**

   * On the right side at a similar vertical position, add a label `Day 90 Reality`.
   * Beneath it, create a 2×2 grid of circular icons (e.g., code editor, idea, checklist, document/metrics).
   * Keep the icons simple and line-based, with a calmer, more muted color palette.

4. **Reality Bullets (Bottom)**

   * Along the bottom of the slide, spanning most of the width, add the three bullets:

     * `LLMs look powerful in demos and benchmarks`
     * `Production workflows expose brittleness, gaps, and glue code`
     * `Most value today comes from humans and AI working together`
   * Left-align the bullets and ensure there is enough line spacing for readability.

5. **Composition**

   * The upper area should read visually as a contrast between loud promises and steady reality.
   * The lower text strip provides your sober commentary; keep it clean and easy to read.

## Slide 3 — Two stories we tell about AI

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Two stories we tell about AI

Agent Fantasy:
- Humans Direct. AI Executes.
- “I delegate and wait.”

Collaborative intelligence:
- Humans and AI in a Tight Loop.
- “We create together.”

- This talk argues for Collaborative Intelligence as the default for serious work.
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title**

   * Place `Two stories we tell about AI` as a large heading at the top of the slide.

2. **Inner Panel**

   * Below the title, draw a large rounded rectangle that sits inside the slide margins.
   * This panel will contain two side-by-side cards.

3. **Left Card — Agent Fantasy**

   * Use a desaturated blue/gray background for the card.
   * At the top of the card, center the label `Agent Fantasy` in small text.
   * Add a circular image or icon near the top (e.g., hunched person at a laptop).
   * In the center of the card, set large text on two lines:

     * `Humans Direct.`
     * `AI Executes.`
   * At the bottom, include the caption: `“I delegate and wait”` in smaller text.
   * In the top-right corner of the card, place a subtle `X` icon to suggest closing/dismissing.

4. **Right Card — Collaborative intelligence**

   * Use a lighter lavender/lilac background for this card.
   * Top label: `Collaborative intelligence`.
   * Add a circular illustration at the top (e.g., profile head with a network/brain motif).
   * Large central text on two lines:

     * `Humans and AI`
     * `in a Tight Loop.`
   * Bottom caption: `“We create together”`.
   * In the top-right corner, add a subtle checkmark icon to indicate this card is selected.

5. **Bottom Caption**

   * Outside the inner panel, at the very bottom of the slide, add:

     * `This talk argues for Collaborative Intelligence as the default for serious work.`
   * Center this line and keep it in a smaller size.

6. **Emphasis**

   * The Collaborative intelligence card should feel slightly more active (e.g., higher contrast, checkmark) but still calm and consistent with the palette.

## Slide 4 — Core Thesis: Humans as Architects

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Core Thesis
_HUMANS AS ARCHITECTS_

“AI tools should treat humans as architects and AI as a smart
junior partner with great pattern-memory.”

1. Humans choose goals and trade-offs
2. AI explores patterns and options
3. Artifacts are drafts for iteration
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title and Kicker**

   * At the top-left, place the title `Core Thesis`.
   * Directly beneath it, add a smaller uppercase kicker: `HUMANS AS ARCHITECTS`.

2. **Quote Block (Left)**

   * Below the title area on the left side, draw a dark rectangular block (navy or deep purple).
   * Inside, set the quote text in white, broken over multiple lines as needed:

     * `“AI tools should treat humans as architects and AI as a smart`
       `junior partner with great pattern-memory.”`
   * Use a generous line height so the quote is easy to read from a distance.

3. **Numbered Points (Right)**

   * On the right side of the slide, vertically center a stack of three markers:

     * `01`, `02`, `03` in circular badges.
   * Next to each badge, place a short line of text:

     * `Humans choose goals and trade-offs`
     * `AI explores patterns and options`
     * `Artifacts are drafts for iteration`
   * Align the text and badges into a clean vertical rhythm.

4. **Balance**

   * The quote block should be the main visual anchor on the left.
   * The numbered list complements it on the right, without competing for attention.

---

## Slide 5 — What’s Wrong With Chat as the UI

### Markdown Structure

```md
# What’s Wrong With Chat as the UI

- Hard to see which messages are decisions versus exploration.
- Alternatives and trade-offs are buried in the scrollback.
- Every message looks the same, regardless of intent.
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Left-Right Comparison**

   * Left: mock generic chat.
   * Right: bullets + small annotations.

2. **Title**

   * Place the title at the top, centered or left-aligned.

3. **Mock Chat Visual (Left)**

   * Create a tall rounded rectangle representing a chat window on the left half.
   * Add 6–8 alternating message bubbles (no need for full text; use lorem-ish or short phrases):

     * A couple of lines like “Option A vs B?” and “Let’s go with the second one” are helpful.
   * Inside the chat window, overlay 2–3 red or accent-colored **circles or callouts** pointing at bits of text, with tiny labels like `Where did we decide?` and `Which option is final?`.

4. **Bullets (Right)**

   * On the right half, vertically center the bullet list.
   * Left-align bullets and keep them in one column.

5. **Subtle Caption**

   * Under the chat mock, add a small caption like `Flat chat stream`.

6. **Spacing & Emphasis**

   * Ensure the chat mock is large enough to be legible from the back of a room, but not so big that it crowds out the text.
   * The bullets should be easy to read and not overshadowed by the visual.

---

## Slide 6 — Principle 1: A Vocabulary of Moves

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Principle 1 — A Vocabulary of Moves

- Define a small set of collaboration moves.
- Give each move a clear name and purpose.
- Model moves explicitly in the protocol or schema.

Moves:
- Propose
- Evaluate
- Refine
- Select / Merge
- Mockup & Review
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title & Intro Text**

   * Place the title at the top-left: `Principle 1 — A Vocabulary of Moves`.
   * Put the 3–4 bullets under the title in a concise block.

2. **Move Palette Visual**

   * Below or to the right of the bullets, create a **horizontal palette** of 5 icons, each representing a move.
   * For each move:

     * Draw a small rounded-rectangle or circle container.
     * Place a simple line icon inside (e.g., lightbulb for Propose, scales for Evaluate, pencil for Refine, merging arrows for Select/Merge, monitor/screen for Mockup).
     * Underneath, add the move label: `Propose`, `Evaluate`, `Refine`, `Select/Merge`, `Mockup & Review`.

3. **Spacing**

   * Ensure equal spacing between each move icon; use alignment guides.
   * The palette should feel like a toolbar in a design tool — clean and evenly spaced.

4. **Color Usage**

   * Use a single accent color for the icon strokes and perhaps for the active move if you want to highlight one during the talk.
   * Keep backgrounds mostly neutral to preserve legibility.

5. **Hierarchy**

   * The text block explains the concept; the palette makes it visual.
   * Don’t overload the slide with additional decoration.

---

## Slide 7 — Structured Cards

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Structured Cards

Top-right bullets:
- Represent AI responses as structured cards.
- Include type, content, and actions on each card.
- Treat cards as the basic unit of work and history.

Card examples:
- “Which data model do you prefer?” (A/B/C with Accept / Refine / Fork)
- “Which flow do you like best?” (flow A vs B with Accept / Refine / Fork)
- “Which of these looks better?” (UI variants with Accept / Refine / Fork)
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title**

   * Place a large title `Structured Cards` at the top-left of the slide.

2. **Top-right Bullet Panel**

   * In the top-right corner, draw a rounded rectangle panel.
   * Inside, show a short bullet list (with small checkmark icons if desired):

     * `Represent AI responses as structured cards`
     * `Include type, content, and actions on each card`
     * `Treat cards as the basic unit of work and history`
   * Use a slightly darker or lighter purple than the background so the panel feels distinct but not loud.

3. **Main Board Layout**

   * Use the remaining space as a board containing three example modules.
   * Each module shows a different kind of structured choice with **Accept / Refine / Fork** buttons.

4. **Module 1 — Data Model Choice (Top-left)**

   * Panel heading: `Which data model do you prefer?`
   * Inside the panel:

     * Three card-like options labeled `Option A`, `Option B`, `Option C`.
     * Each option shows a simple node/graph-like icon.
     * One option (e.g., `Option B`) is visually selected with a border highlight.
   * On the right side of this panel, stack three pill buttons:

     * `Accept`
     * `Refine`
     * `Fork`

5. **Module 2 — Flow Choice (Top-right)**

   * Panel heading: `Which flow do you like best?`
   * Show two bar-like blocks labeled `A` and `B`, representing different flows.
   * To the right of these, repeat the vertical stack of `Accept`, `Refine`, `Fork` buttons.

6. **Module 3 — Visual Choice (Bottom-left)**

   * Panel heading: `Which of these looks better?`
   * Show two UI thumbnails side by side (e.g., `Option A` and `Option A` with different styling, as in your slide).
   * To the right of these thumbnails, again place the `Accept`, `Refine`, `Fork` button stack.

7. **Styling**

   * Each module panel should have a soft gray background, subtle shadow, and rounded corners.
   * Keep card and button styles consistent across modules.
   * Ensure the examples read clearly at a glance even without reading every label.

## Slide 8 — Not Just Multiple Choice

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Not Just Multiple Choice

Prompt:
- Which of these looks better?

Options:
- Option A
- Option B
- Option C

Feedback example:
- "I like the header in Option A, but the UI polish is better in Option B."

Quote:
- "The LLM's superpower is its ability to fluidly mix and match ideas and create a cohesive result."
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title**

   * Place the title `Not Just Multiple Choice` at the top of the slide.

2. **Central Panel**

   * In the center of the slide, draw a large rounded rectangle panel with a soft gray background.
   * At the top of this panel, add the heading `Which of these looks better?`.

3. **Options Row**

   * Inside the panel, create a row of three option cards:

     * Each card shows a simple UI thumbnail and a label: `Option A`, `Option B`, `Option C`.
   * Match the iconography and styling used in the `Structured Cards` slide.

4. **Accept / Refine / Fork Column**

   * On the right side of the panel, stack three pill buttons vertically:

     * `Accept`
     * `Refine`
     * `Fork`
   * Use the same button styling as on the `Structured Cards` slide, with one state (e.g., `Accept`) highlighted if desired.

5. **Freeform Feedback Bubble**

   * Below the options row, still inside the panel, add a large white speech bubble or text box.
   * Put the example feedback inside: `I like the header in Option A, but the UI polish is better in Option B.`
   * At the right edge of the bubble, include a small `X` icon and an upward arrow/send icon.

6. **Bottom Quote Strip**

   * At the bottom of the slide, outside the central panel, draw a dark rectangular strip spanning most of the width.
   * Inside, center the quote:

     * `“The LLM's superpower is its ability to fluidly mix and match ideas and create a cohesive result.”`

7. **Conceptual Emphasis**

   * The panel should make it visually obvious that the user can both pick options and give blended feedback.
   * The quote strip reinforces the idea of compositional reasoning.

---

## Slide 9 — Interaction Patterns: Accept, Refine, Fork

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Interaction Patterns — Accept, Refine, Fork

- Accept adds this card to the shared Decisions rail.
- Refine opens a focused edit flow and updates the same card.
- Fork creates a new variant card and branches the artifacts.
- Each action has its own micro-flow, not just “back to chat.”
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Overall Structure**

   * Keep the same visual language as `Structured Cards` and `Not Just Multiple Choice`:

     * Purple slide background.
     * A large, soft gray panel in the center acting as a board.
   * Title `Interaction Patterns — Accept, Refine, Fork` at the top of the slide.

2. **Starting Card Row**

   * At the top of the gray panel, centered, place a single card labeled `Workspace model options`.
   * To the right of this card, stack three pill buttons vertically: `Accept`, `Refine`, `Fork`.
   * This row mirrors earlier slides so the user recognizes the pattern.

3. **Three Outcome Panels**

   * Below the starting row, divide the gray panel into three side-by-side sub-panels, one for each action.
   * Each sub-panel has a small heading and a simple diagram of the resulting flow.

4. **Accept Panel (Left)**

   * Heading: `Accept`.
   * Show the starting card again, now with a small pill label in a corner: `Committed`.
   * Directly below, draw the **Decisions rail**:

     * A horizontal bar labeled `Decisions` or `Decisions / Timeline`.
     * Place several small card thumbnails along the bar as nodes.
     * Highlight one node (the current card) with a border or glow; other nodes appear faded.
   * Optional caption under the panel: `Accept → add this card to the Decisions rail and carry it forward.`

5. **Refine Panel (Center)**

   * Heading: `Refine`.
   * In the upper part of the panel, show the starting card on the left and a **refinement side panel** on the right:

     * Side panel title: `What should we refine?`
     * Checklist items such as `Naming`, `Constraints`, `Edge cases`, `Structure`.
     * A small `Notes` textarea at the bottom.
   * Below this pair, show a new version of the card, labeled `Workspace model options v2` with a small `v2` or `Updated` tag.
   * Optional small Decisions rail fragment beneath, showing that `v2` will be what lands there when accepted.
   * Caption: `Refine → run a focused edit flow, then update this card as the canonical version.`

6. **Fork Panel (Right)**

   * Heading: `Fork`.
   * At the top of the panel, show the starting card feeding into a split arrow.
   * At the ends of the split arrow, place two cards:

     * Left: `Workspace model (original)`.
     * Right: `Workspace model — lightweight` or `Workspace model — variant`.
   * Optionally, give the variant card a small tag such as `New branch`.
   * Beneath, you can hint at how both cards can later be Accepted independently into the Decisions rail (e.g., small rail with two nodes labeled `original` and `variant`).
   * Caption: `Fork → create a new variant card and artifact branch.`

7. **Decisions Rail Design Notes**

   * The Decisions rail should be a recurring visual element:

     * A slim horizontal bar with evenly spaced nodes representing accepted cards.
     * Each node is a tiny card thumbnail or labeled dot.
     * The most recent or currently selected decision is highlighted; older ones are still visible but de-emphasized.
   * Use this same rail design wherever you need to show “where accepted cards go” (e.g., in the Structured Canvas slide).

8. **Not Just Chat Reminder**

   * Below the gray panel, add a small line of secondary text:

     * `Each action opens a structured next step — you never just fall back into an undifferentiated chat box.`
   * Keep the font small so it reads as an annotation, not a fourth bullet.

## Slide 10 — Principle 2: Abstraction-First Design

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Principle 2 — Abstraction-First Design

- Start with concepts, entities, and invariants.
- Let UI, APIs, docs, and copy project from the same model.
- Use AI to help form and test these abstractions.

Entities (example):
- Workspace
- Member
- Role
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title & Bullets**

   * Title at top-left, bullets beneath.

2. **Abstraction Hub Diagram**

   * In the center-right of the slide, draw a **central rounded rectangle** labeled `Data Model`.
   * Inside, list 2–3 entities: `Workspace`, `Member`, `Role`.
   * From this central box, draw **four spokes** outward:

     * Top: `UI`
     * Right: `API`
     * Bottom: `Docs`
     * Left: `Copy` (or adjust positions as feels natural)
   * At the end of each spoke, place a small icon:

     * UI: simple screen/window icon.
     * API: curly braces or plug icon.
     * Docs: document page icon.
     * Copy: text / quotation icon.

3. **Arrow Directions**

   * Make arrows **bidirectional** to imply synchronization.

4. **Visual Emphasis**

   * Slightly thicken the border of the Data Model box to make it visually central.
   * Use accent color on the Data Model border or label; keep spokes more neutral.

5. **Balance**

   * Keep the diagram large and clear enough to be legible from a distance.
   * Avoid too many extra entities or details; this is a conceptual abstraction, not a full schema.

## Slide 11 — Principle 3: UI as Part of the Intelligence

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Principle 3 — UI as Part of the Intelligence

- Use the UI to expose how the system is thinking.
- Show alternatives and trade-offs side by side.
- Make history and diffs visible and easy to review.
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Split UI Comparison**

   * Similar to Slide 5, use a left-right split.
   * Left: plain chat UI.
   * Right: structured canvas UI.

2. **Title & Bullets**

   * Place the title along the top.
   * Put the bullet list in the lower area, spanning the full width or aligned under the right panel.

3. **Left Panel (Chat-only)**

   * Draw a chat window like on Slide 5 but **simpler and smaller**.
   * Label it `Chat-only` in small text beneath or above.

4. **Right Panel (Structured Canvas)**

   * Draw a larger rectangle representing a canvas or board.
   * Inside this board, include:

     * 2–3 smaller cards similar to Slide 7.
     * A simple mini flow diagram (boxes with arrows) above or beside the cards.
     * A Decisions rail along the bottom: a slim horizontal bar with small card nodes representing accepted decisions, including the current card highlighted.
   * Label this panel `Structured canvas` in small text.

5. **Visual Weighting**

   * Make the right panel larger and slightly more saturated to indicate it’s the focus.
   * The left panel should feel like the baseline, not the hero.

6. **Consistency**

   * Reuse card styling from Slide 7 and diagram lines from Slide 6/8 so the visual language feels cohesive.

---

## Slide 12 — Principle 4: Memory & Living Artifacts

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Principle 4 — Memory & Living Artifacts

- Treat the work as a long-lived project, not a single prompt.
- Organize context into layers: tokens, messages, cards, narrative.
- Keep a small set of canonical artifacts that summarize decisions.

Layers:
- Tokens
- Messages
- Cards / Artifacts
- Project Narrative / Timeline
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title & Bullets**

   * Title at top-left; bullets below.

2. **Memory Stack Diagram**

   * In the center/right, create a **stacked-layer graphic**:

     * Four horizontal rectangles stacked vertically.
     * Label them from bottom to top:

       * `Tokens`
       * `Messages`
       * `Cards / Artifacts`
       * `Project Narrative / Timeline`
   * Use progressively **lighter shades** as you go up, or vice versa, but ensure the `Cards / Artifacts` and `Project Narrative` layers are visually emphasized (e.g., thicker border or accent color).

3. **Re-entry Arrow**

   * Draw an arrow from the right-hand side labeled `You re-enter here` pointing to the `Cards / Artifacts` or `Project Narrative` layer.

4. **Example Artifacts**

   * Inside the `Cards / Artifacts` layer, you can place tiny mini-card shapes labeled `Team Workspaces Data Model v1` and `Onboarding Flow v2`.

5. **Overall Feel**

   * This diagram should read like an information architecture, not like a chart.
   * Keep typography minimal inside boxes so labels are legible.

---

## Slide 13 — Principle 5: Human Taste, Values & Weirdness

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Principle 5 — Human Taste, Values & Weirdness

- Preserve the team’s voice, ethics, and visual language.
- Use AI to suggest options within those constraints.
- Make it easy to steer outputs: “more like this, less like that.”
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Split Style Comparison**

   * Two side-by-side mock UIs to illustrate generic vs opinionated design.

2. **Title & Bullets**

   * Title at top.
   * Bullets in a column near the bottom or between/under the mocks.

3. **Left Mock (Generic AI Output)**

   * Draw a simple UI frame with:

     * Over-rounded corners.
     * Low hierarchy: similar font sizes, little contrast.
     * Gray buttons, generic labels like `Button` and `Card Title`.
   * Label this mock in small text as `Generic AI output`.

4. **Right Mock (Your Product’s Voice)**

   * Draw a similar UI frame, but with:

     * Clear visual hierarchy (strong title, secondary text, distinct button style).
     * More intentional layout: alignment, spacing, constrained color palette.
     * Copy that sounds more like you (e.g., `Review workspace model` instead of `Button`).
   * Label this `Your product’s voice`.

5. **Visual Cue**

   * Add a subtle checkmark icon or small highlight near the right mock.

6. **Color & Typography**

   * Keep both mocks in a limited palette, but give the right one more deliberate, structured styling.

## Slide 14 — Example: Designing "Team Workspaces" with AI

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Example — Designing “Team Workspaces” with AI

- Describe the feature goal, constraints, and context.
- Co-design the data model, then flows and UI on top of it.
- Use cards to review options, annotate, and commit decisions.

Journey steps:
1. Goal
2. Abstractions
3. Data Model
4. Flows & UI
5. Review
6. Sync
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title & Bullets**

   * Title at top.
   * Bullets in a compact block under the title or at the bottom.

2. **Journey Map Diagram**

   * In the center, create a **horizontal journey** with 6 nodes:

     * `Goal` → `Abstractions` → `Data Model` → `Flows & UI` → `Review` → `Sync`
   * Represent each node as a circle or rounded rectangle.
   * Connect them with arrows pointing left-to-right.

3. **Mini-cards Under Nodes**

   * Under some of the nodes, add tiny card thumbnails:

     * Under `Abstractions`: small card labeled `Entities & relationships`.
     * Under `Data Model`: card `Workspace model v1`.
     * Under `Flows & UI`: card `Create workspace flow`.
     * Under `Review`: card `Feedback & annotations`.

4. **Styling**

   * Use consistent shape sizes and spacing between nodes.
   * Use the accent color to highlight the flow direction.

5. **Legibility**

   * Ensure labels on nodes are short and readable.
   * Avoid clutter by limiting cards to 3–4 simple ones.

## Slide 15 — Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- A single “do everything” agent that returns huge, opaque outputs.
- An endless chat stream with no labeled decisions or artifacts.
- Approval workflows that lack concrete versions or branches.
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Three-Panel Comic Layout**

   * Divide the slide into three equal vertical panels.

2. **Panel 1 — Wall of Output**

   * Draw a door with a label `Agent` or an abstract AI node behind it.
   * In front of the door, a huge stack or scroll of documents.
   * Caption at bottom: `Wall of output`.

3. **Panel 2 — Lost in Chat**

   * Draw a tall chat window filled with tiny text.
   * A small human icon at the bottom looking overwhelmed.
   * Caption: `Lost in chat`.

4. **Panel 3 — Rubber-stamp Review**

   * Draw a document with dense text and a big stamp icon over it.
   * Human figure holding the stamp, looking uncertain.
   * Caption: `Rubber-stamp review`.

5. **Bullets Placement**

   * Place the bullet list either at the top or bottom of the slide, spanning all three panels.
   * Use the bullets to label the patterns in more precise language.

6. **Styling**

   * Keep illustrations minimalist, line-based, in the same style as other diagrams.
   * Optionally use a subtle warning color (e.g., amber) for these panels.

## Slide 16 — Organizational Implications

### Markdown Structure

```md
# Organizational Implications

- Plan features around shared abstractions and flows.
- Use canvases and cards as the main shared artifact.
- Evaluate tools by whether they improve decisions and trust.
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Title & Bullets**

   * Title at top.
   * Bullets in a left-aligned column.

2. **Org Collaboration Diagram**

   * On the right, draw three main nodes: `Product`, `Design`, `Engineering`.
   * Arrange them in a triangle or horizontal row.
   * In the center of them, place a node labeled `AI Collaborator`.
   * Beneath the AI Collaborator, place a small `Canvas / Cards` icon.

3. **Connections**

   * Draw lines from each of Product/Design/Engineering to both the AI Collaborator and the Canvas/Cards icon.
   * This should read like a collaboration hub, not a reporting structure.

4. **Metrics Labels**

   * Around the diagram, place small labels like:

     * `Time to good abstraction`
     * `Reviewable decisions`
     * `Team trust`
   * Keep these in smaller, secondary text.

5. **Emphasis**

   * Highlight that the canvas/cards node sits at the center of collaboration.

## Slide 17 — The Collaborative AI Creed

### Markdown Structure

```md
# The Collaborative AI Creed

- AI as collaborator, not protagonist.
- A vocabulary of moves, not undifferentiated chat.
- Abstraction-first: data models at the center.
- UI as part of the intelligence.
- Memory as living, segmentable artifacts.
- Human taste, values, and weirdness on top.

> Collaborative AI tools are cognitive prosthetics that work through structured, high-bandwidth UI—where humans design the abstractions, and the AI explores, proposes, and refines within that frame.
```

### Layout Instructions

1. **Poster-Style Layout**

   * Treat this slide like a poster or manifesto, simple and bold.

2. **Title**

   * Center `The Collaborative AI Creed` at the top.

3. **Creed Bullets**

   * Place the six bullets in a single centered column.
   * Use slightly larger line spacing; each line should feel like a maxim.

4. **Quote Block**

   * Place the quote at the bottom in a slightly smaller but still readable size.
   * Optionally italicize and indent the quote.

5. **Icon Row (Optional)**

   * Above or beside the bullets, add a subtle row of small icons representing each principle (collaborator, moves, abstraction, UI, memory, human taste).
   * Keep them small so they don’t compete with the text.

6. **Minimal Background**

   * Use a calm background color; avoid patterns.
   * This is the slide people will want to screenshot—keep it clean.

*End of spec.*
